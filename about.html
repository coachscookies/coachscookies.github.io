      <H1> The Company </H1>
      <p> This company is the result of a famous cookie recipe that became
        popular in different areas of Broward County. The creator of this
        recipe is a man named Dwight Garner who was a coach throughout the
         Broward county community, famous for the wide straw hat he would
         wear during games. He simply made a hobby out of baking these cookies
          for his family and friends. But what began as a hobby soon turned
           into requests from friends and acquaintances advocating the selling
            of these cookies. We’re just simply making your wish our command!
             It’s a family company down to its core with every single member
             involved in some aspect. We consider it a privilege to make a
              positive contribution to the community in the form of decadent
               chocolate chip cookies. Allow us to extend our family and make
                you a part of it! </p>
